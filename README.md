An artist's landing page Website

## Task
To build an easy to understand website for a local artist that would showcase their art and allow prospective clients to contact them. 

## Criteria
My criteria for creating this project was to create something that showcased my ability to use HTML, CSS, Sass, and Vanilla JavaScript to created a simple, interactive website with a clear message of who my client was, a gallery of their work, and a way for customers to contact them.

## Summary of Stack
I built the front-end of the website with HTML, CSS, and Javacsript. I specifically did not use any frameworks because I want to practice the fundamentals with this project. The framework skills are shown in my projects that are listed on the site. The client needed to save money on hosting so we went with Netlify and a basic domain name. 

## Design
My design was meant to be simple and easy to navigate. I hoped the users would be able to quickly see any art and how to get a hold of the artist.  

## Run Locally
To run locally clone the repository to your current machine.
Go to the index file and open it with your browser.
To edit the Sass open the repository with a IDE and use your terminal to execute "npm run sass" , this will executed the node script to update your Sass changes.
